~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Lombok constructors ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
@NoArgsConstructor: Generates a no-argument constructor.
@AllArgsConstructor: Generates a constructor with one parameter for each field in the class.
@RequiredArgsConstructor: Generates a constructor with one parameter for each final field or field annotated with @NonNull.

(throw error while compile time)If we are using @NoArgsConstructor and also defining noArgConstructor in our class then spring boot will excecute our defined noArgConstructor.
